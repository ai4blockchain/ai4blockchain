Workshop on Advances in Artificial Intelligence for Blockchain (AIChain 2019)
Co-located with 2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain

14 July 2019

This workshop promotes a broadened scope of augmenting smart contracts and blockchain based systems with advances in AI. Constructing smart contracts that function as autonomous agents, provide feedback, and re-plan execution making allowances for circumstances encountered during execution are new areas of research that we expect to highlight at this workshop. Another important goal of this workshop is to provide cross-fertilization between different fields that are either already using or plan to use AI in blockchain and smart contracts.

Workshop Topics: 
* AI-based Smart Contract Languages
* AI-based Consensus Mechanisms
* Smart Contracts Analysis
* AI for Decentralized Applications
* Methods for Detecting Issues in Smart Contracts
* Methods for Augmenting Smart contracts
