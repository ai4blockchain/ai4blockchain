									<h4 id="scope">Objectives and Scope</h4>
									<p>
										Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are widely hailed to be leading the
										way to the fourth industrial revolution. The two technologies on their own have
										been revolutionary in the last decade. However, the potential of combining these
										two technologies poses exciting opportunities and challenges, which is at a
										nascent stage.
									</p>

									<p>This workshop aims to explore the synergistic combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain and to identify the disruptors, especially in terms of the application potential of the combination of these two technologies as they are widely hailed to be leading the way to the fourth industrial revolution. Both AI and blockchain technologies on their own have been revolutionary in the last decade. However, the potential of combining these two technologies poses exciting opportunities and challenges, which are at a nascent stage. We intend to discuss how leveraging blockchain technology can benefit AI and how applying AI can enhance the capabilities of blockchain technology. We believe this workshop would elucidate the scope of augmenting blockchain technology, including consensus mechanisms and smart contracts with advances in AI. Moreover, constructing decentralized applications powered by blockchain technology, that function as autonomous agents, is a new area of research that we expect to highlight at this workshop. Providing cross-fertilization between different domains that are either already using or planning to use AI in blockchain technologies is another important goal of this workshop. We will have a stronger focus on AI theory and practices related to blockchain technologies in this edition of the workshop. Specifically, we will invite papers and short abstracts on novel approaches, applications, and work in progress research in the context of applying AI to blockchain technology as well as leveraging blockchain to advance AI. Selected regular papers will be presented as podium talks, and shorter poster papers will be showcased as poster presentations. </p>

									</ul>



									<h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>

									<p>
										Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 8 pages in <a href="www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format</a> (or up to 10 pages with the pages over length charge), including tables, figures, references, and appendices.

										Submissions presenting early stages of research and development in the solicited topics are encouraged.
									</p>

									<p>
										All papers need to be submitted electronically in PDF through the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aichain2021">Easychair Submission Link</a>.
										Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with articles that
										have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to another workshop or
										a conference with proceedings or a journal. 
										
										Papers will be selected based on their originality,
										significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least three
										reviewers. All submitted papers will be judged through double-blind reviews,
										where the authors' identities are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you
										are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same
										time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work,
										including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission
										policies will be rejected without review.
									</p>

									<p>
										Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper
										be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference
										to present the work.</p>
