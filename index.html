    <h4 id="scope">Objectives and Scope</h4>
		<p>
			Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are widely hailed to be leading the way to the fourth industrial revolution. The two technologies on their own have been revolutionary in the last decade. However, the potential of combining these two technologies poses exciting opportunities and challenges, which is at a nascent stage. 
        </p>
        
        <p>The workshop aims to explore the synergies between AI and blockchain technologies and to identify the disruptors, especially in terms of the application potential of the combination of the two technologies. We intend to discuss how leveraging blockchain technology can benefit AI and how applying AI can enhance the capabilities of blockchain technology. We believe this workshop would elucidate the scope of augmenting blockchain technology, including consensus mechanisms and smart contracts with advances in AI. Moreover, constructing decentralized applications powered by blockchain technology, that function as autonomous agents, is a new area of research that we expect to highlight at this workshop. Providing cross-fertilization between different domains that are either already using or planning to use AI in blockchain technologies is another important goal of this workshop.</p>

                        <p>Invited Talk: <b>A Digital Future of Financial Markets</b> (25 min presentation + 5 min Q&A)</p>
                        <p>The G20 financial regulatory reforms introduced in the wake of the financial crisis have fundamentally altered the traditional operating structure of bilateral financial markets. Firms have implemented these regulations and associated requirements on top of existing infrastructure, placing significant new demands upon it. These new regulatory requirements have also led to the creation of significant amounts of unstructured data and the proliferation of bespoke, paper-based contracts.  Financial institutions are increasingly looking to technology, including DLT, smart contracts and AI, to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. However, scalable and interoperable automation is only achievable if the right foundations are in place first. 
 
                        Technology developers rely upon easily accessible and open-source technology standards, allowing them to focus on innovation and development. Fragmented and duplicative distribution of digital offerings will inevitably result in incompatible and inefficient platforms and solutions.  Trade associations such as ISDA will play a crucial role in leader the development of essential data standards and the distribution of these standards in digital formats to allow direct deployment within enhanced, automated and intelligent processes, systems and technology.
                             
                        This talk will focus on ISDA’s vision for the future of financial markets, the role that technology can play in delivering this future and the various digital initiatives that ISDA is engaged in.</p>

                        <p>Although Blockchain is still an emerging technology it has the potential to serve as a general purpose Information and Communication Technology platform. Already, smart contract / chaincode platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, provide support for the execution of arbitrary computations. However, the suitability of these platforms for specifying and enforcing data and service usage constraints (e.g., usage policies, regulatory obligations, societal norms) and providing guarantees with respect to conformance has yet to be determined. In order to address this gap, in this position paper we argue that symbolic artificial intelligence techniques in the form of semantic technology based policy languages and business process conformance tools and techniques, can together be used to provide guarantees with respect to the behaviour of autonomous smart contract / chaincode applications.</p>

                        <p>In this talk we discuss the basics of the IOTA cryptosystem. Namely, we will outline its main principles and the reasoning behind the key design choices. One of the important features is the inherent freedom embedded in the protocol -- the network participants have a wide choice of possible behaviors; this potentially opens possibilities for applications of AI. We then also discuss the IOTA's approach to achieving consensus that uses a probabilistic voting protocol (FPC-BI) of low communicational complexity.

                        <p>	
                            Federated Learning harnesses data from multiple sources to build a single model. While the initial model might belong solely to the actor bringing it to the network for training, determining the ownership of the trained model resulting from Federated Learning remains an open question. In this paper we explore how Blockchains (in particular Ethereum) can be used to represent the evolving ownership of a model trained with Federated Learning. Firstly, we describe a metric to evaluate the relative contributivity of participants in a Federated Learning process. Next, we introduce 2CP, a framework comprising two novel protocols for Blockchained Federated Learning, which both reward contributors with shares in the final model based on their relative contributivity. The Crowdsource Protocol allows an actor to bring a model forward for training, and use their own data to evaluate the contributions made to it. Potential trainers are guaranteed a fair share of the resulting model, even in a trustless setting. The Consortium Protocol gives trainers the same guarantee even when no party owns the initial model and no evaluator is available. We conduct experiments with the MNIST dataset that reveal sound contributivity scores resulting from both Protocols by rewarding larger datasets with higher scores. Our experiments also showed the necessity to pair 2CP with a robust model aggregation mechanism to discard low quality inputs coming from model poisoning attacks.</p>

                        <p>Paper: <b>Blockchain-Orchestrated Machine Learning for Privacy Preserving Federated Learning in Electronic Health Data</b> (20 min presentation + 5 min Q&A)</p>

                        <p>Machine learning and blockchain technology have been explored for potential applications in medicine with only modest success to date. Focus has shifted to exploring the intersection of these technologies along with other privacy preserving encryption techniques for better utility. This combination applied to federated learning, which allows remote execution of function and analysis without the need to move highly regulated personal health information, seems to be the key to successful applications of these technologies to rapidly advance evidence-based medicine. We explore a brief history of these technologies in medicine, outlining some of the challenges with successful use. We explored a more detailed combination of usage with an emphasis on decentralizing or federating the learning process along with auditability and incentivization blockchain can allow in the machine learning process. Based on the cost-benefit analysis of previous efforts, we provide the framework for an advanced blockchain-orchestrated machine learning system for privacy preserving federated learning in medicine and a new utility in health. Six critical elements for this approach in the future will be: (a) Data and analytic processes discoverable on secure public blockchain while retaining privacy of the data and analytic processes (b) Value fabricated by generating data/compute matches that were previously illegal, unethical and infeasible (c) Compute guarantees provided by federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs (d) Privacy guarantees provided by software (e.g., differential privacy) and hardware (e.g., federated learning aggregation on Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP) cryptography (e) Data quality incentivized via tokenized reputation-based rewards (f) Discarding of poor data accomplished via model poisoning attack prevention techniques</p>

                        <p>Blockchain and artificial intelligence are considered as emerging technologies that have recently drawn attention. The two technologies can be expected to have synergies through convergence with other technologies as the underlying technology. A neural key exchange is a secret key exchange technique based on neural synchronization of the neural network. Authenticated key exchange techniques with implicit authentication that did not increase communication overhead were proposed, but they did not propose a realistic distribution of shared secret values for authentication. In this paper, we propose the idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, We present a way to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain. The proposed idea can be seen as a good example of improving artificial intelligence-based technology and gaining synergy with decentralized blockchain technology.</p>

        <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>

        <p>We invite papers on novel approaches, applications, and work in progress research in the context of applying AI to blockchain technology as well as leveraging blockchain to advance AI. Selected regular papers will be presented as podium talks. </p>

        <p>All papers need to be submitted electronically through the <a href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=27582">conference website</a> with PDF format. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with articles that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to another workshop or a conference with proceedings or a journal. Papers must be presented in English, must not exceed 6 pages in IEEE Computer Society proceedings format (or up to 8 pages with the pages over length charge), including tables, figures, references, and appendices. Papers will be selected based on their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least three reviewers. All submitted papers will be judged through double-blind reviews, where the authors' identities are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.</p>

        <p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. AIChain2020 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference. All accepted papers will be published in IEEE CPS proceedings (EI Indexed) and collected by IEEE Xplore Digital Library.</p>
