														The development of a single technology is barely important for our technological future. Instead, it is the combined power that emerging technologies (like blockchain, AI, cloud, IoT, quantum, AR/VR) can unleash that will transform the global economy. From the 4th Industrial Revolution (the so-called "smart factory") to Facebook's Metaverse, convergence dynamics are defining the trajectory of our socioeconomic systems, with data as its fuel and exhaust. Blockchain technologies can serve as the trust layer for the responsible, secure and privacy-preserving use of data towards a human-centered global economy.

													<p style="text-align:justify">
														The use of blockchain in cyber-physical systems, such as
														robotics, is an area with immense potential to address many
														shortcomings in robotic coordination and control.
														In traditional swarm robotic applications, where homogeneous
														robots are utilized, it is possible to replace a robot if it
														malfunctions, and it can be assumed that all robots are
														interchangeable.
														However, in many real-world applications spanning from search
														and rescue missions to future household robotic appliances,
														heterogeneous robots will need to work
														together with the other robots and human agents to achieve
														specific tasks. Nevertheless, no such system exists. Therefore,
														we propose a system that utilizes a token economy for robotic
														agents that makes agents responsive to token acquisition as an
														incentive for collaboration in achieving a given task. The
														economy enables the system to self-govern, even under Byzantine
														and adversarial settings.
														We further incorporate a novel subcontracting framework within a
														blockchain environment to allow the robotic agents to
														efficiently and cost-effectively
														perform complex jobs requiring multiple agents with various
														capabilities.
														We conducted a thorough evaluation of the system in a prototype
														warehouse application scenario, and the results
														are promising.

													<p style="text-align:justify">
														This paper proposes a blockchain-based
														traceability system of photos.
														Thanks to a novel scheme that securely chains certificates of
														image data originating from a trusted origin certificate, the
														system authenticates the provenance of original and converted
														images, e.g., which digital camera created it.
														The system requires a Public Key
														Infrastructure (PKI) of digital cameras to authenticate the
														trusted origin certificate signed by the certified digital
														camera.
														It does not require a PKI of image conversion software.
														The proposed solution is suitable for the traceability system of
														photos on the Internet as the scheme of chaining certificates
														applies to any image conversion software, including open
														source-based photo editing applications and cloud server
														software that converts image data of photos.
														We have implemented a prototype of the traceability system using
														Ethereum as a permissioned blockchain and evaluated the
														system's feasibility.

									<h4 id="scope">Objectives and Scope</h4>
									<p>
										Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are widely hailed to be leading the
										way to the fourth industrial revolution. The two technologies on their own have
										been revolutionary in the last decade. However, the potential of combining these
										two technologies poses exciting opportunities and challenges, which is at a
										nascent stage.
									</p>

									<p>This workshop aims to explore the synergistic combination of Artificial
										Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain and to identify the disruptors, especially in
										terms of the application potential of the combination of these two technologies
										as they are widely hailed to be leading the way to the fourth industrial
										revolution.
										We intend to discuss how leveraging blockchain technology can benefit AI
										and how applying AI can enhance the capabilities of blockchain technology. We
										believe this workshop would elucidate the scope of augmenting blockchain
										technology, including consensus mechanisms and smart contracts with advances in
										AI. Moreover, constructing decentralized applications powered by blockchain
										technology, that function as autonomous agents, is a new area of research that
										we expect to highlight at this workshop. Providing cross-fertilization between
										different domains that are either already using or planning to use AI in
										blockchain technologies is another important goal of this workshop. We will have
										a stronger focus on AI theory and practices related to blockchain technologies
										in this edition of the workshop. Specifically, we will invite papers and short
										abstracts on novel approaches, applications, and work in progress research in
										the context of applying AI to blockchain technology as well as leveraging
										blockchain to advance AI. Selected regular papers will be presented as podium
										talks, and shorter poster papers will be showcased as poster presentations. </p>

									<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>
									The topics include but were not limited to:
									<ul>
										<li>AI-based consensus mechanisms for blockchain </li>
										<li>AI for decentralized applications</li>
										<li>AI and semantic representations for off-chaining data</li>
										<li>AI for the analysis of smart contracts and data stored on the blockchain
										</li>
										<li>AI-assisted smart oracles </li>
										<li>AI-assisted smart contract generation for blockchain </li>
										<li>Anomaly detection in smart contracts using AI </li>
										<li>Federated and distributed learning using blockchain frameworks</li>
										<li>Blockchain for data privacy and AI model integrity </li>
										<li>Differential privacy </li>
										<li>Challenges of adopting blockchain technology to assist AI </li>
										<li>Secure multiparty computation </li>
										<li>Homomorphic encryption</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
									<p>
										Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 8 pages in <a
											href="www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Computer
											Society Proceedings Format</a> (or up to 10 pages with the pages over length
										charge), including tables, figures, references, and appendices.

										Submissions presenting early stages of research and development in the solicited
										topics are encouraged.
									</p>

									<p>
										All papers need to be submitted electronically in PDF through the <a
											href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aichain2021">Easychair
											Submission Link</a>.
										Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with articles that
										have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to another workshop or
										a conference with proceedings or a journal.

										Papers will be selected based on their originality,
										significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least three
										reviewers. All submitted papers will be judged through double-blind reviews,
										where the authors' identities are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you
										are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same
										time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work,
										including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission
										policies will be rejected without review.
									</p>

									<p>
										Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper
										be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference
										to present the work.</p>
